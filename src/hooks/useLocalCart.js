// I am now addicted to using custom hooks...
// this is to use localstorage to save an array of product objects

// INITIAL CHECK
// every time this hook is used, we need to make sure there is at least an empty cart object in the localstorage to avoid null errors.

// addProductToCart()
// generate an object that contains the product id, the quantity added to the cart and the variant.
