// I am now addicted to using custom hooks...
// this is to use localstorage to save a single product into an array of product ids in localstorage.

// INITIAL CHECK
// every time this hook is used, we need to make sure there is at least an empty cart object in the localstorage to avoid null errors.

// CHECK IF THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN ADDED TO CART
// e

// addProductToCart()
// generate an object that contains the product id, the quantity added to the cart and the variant.

const useAddToCart = () => {};
